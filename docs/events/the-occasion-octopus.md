# The Occasion Octopus

This website lets people list any events of interest in their account.

While there is options for private data, all public events have full JSON and iCal feeds with no access token needed.

It is also federated using the ActivityPub protocol.

There is a full write API, and various bots are already written to collect events from other sources and add them here.

[More information can be found on their website.](https://www.theoccasionoctopus.net/)
